# data-challenge-winners
Repo for the data challenge of the SD207 course at Télécom ParisTech. June 2016

The task consisted in detecting insulting messages from social media. The data was taken from a Kaggle challenge.

Our C++ lib contains basic feature extraction from text and a logistic regression on sparse data.
To use it, you will need to install libraries:

Boost, Armadillo, OpenBlas, Lapack, Arpack, SuperLU (facultative).
Check the how-to-install file to get more precisions for installations (in french!).
